    "description": "Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency. It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.\r\n\r\nBeing the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by Ethereum which led to the development of other amazing projects such as EOS, Tron, and even crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties.",

    "description": "Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible. Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.\r\n\r\nOn Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain. The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand.",

    "description": "Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S. dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange Bitfinex).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like Poloniex or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Ripple is the catchall name for the cryptocurrency platform, the transactional protocol for which is actually XRP, in the same fashion as Ethereum is the name for the platform that facilitates trades in Ether. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.\r\n\r\nRipple was originally founded by a single company, Ripple Labs, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue bitcoin’s development. It also doesn’t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself — around 60 billion at the latest count.\r\n\r\nEven at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple’s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency’s value, and isn’t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.\r\n\r\nXRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency of the Binance platform. It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name \"Binance\" is a combination of binary and finance.\r\n\r\nThus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other. It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat. The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.\r\n\r\nIn total, there will only be 200 million BNBs. Binance uses the ERC20 token standard from Ethereum and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors. The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. \r\n\r\nThe schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.\r\n\r\nBinance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors. In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.\r\n\r\nOther tokens that are issued by exchanges include Bibox Token, OKB, Huobi Token, and more.",

    "description": "Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency based on the popular \"Doge\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. Dogecoin is a Litecoin fork. Introduced as a \"joke currency\" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. \r\n\r\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\r\n\r\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.\r\n\r\nTo purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading. ",

    "description": "What is Tron?\r\nTron's mission is to build a truly decentralized internet and aims to be the largest blockchain-based operating system in the world, known as the TRON protocol. The TRON protocol will offer high scalability, high availability, and high throughput computing to serve decentralized applications via smart contracts. Ethereum EVM-based smart contracts will be compatible and deployable on the TRON network as such Solidity developers do not have to rewrite their applications.\r\n\r\nWhy Tron?\r\nSince TRON protocol does not rely on proof of work or mining, instead governed by nodes located around the world, it is decentralized while providing high throughput for transactions on the blockchain. This is suitable for dapps that require high speed transactions especially games. There are a number of tokens already issued on the TRON network and the decentralized exchanges TRX.market has launched.\r\n\r\nOn July 24th 2018, TRON acquired BitTorrent, one of the largest P2P file sharing protocol. As a result of the acquisition, BitTorrent Token (BTT) was launched as the cryptocurrency to power the economics on the BitTorrent network. The Token will be used to inceltivize file sharing and storage within the network.\r\n",

    "description": "The Stellar network is an open source, distributed, and community owned network used to facilitate cross-asset transfers of value. Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like XRP and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.\r\n\r\nDistributed Exchange\r\nThrough the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.\r\n\r\nThis multi-currency transaction is possible because of \"Anchors\". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people’s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.\r\n\r\nLumens (XLM)\r\nLumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. \r\n\r\nPrior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.\r\n\r\nAs the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn’t working as intended — account holders either didn’t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise — and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe inflation operation is now deprecated.\r\nhttps://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/inflation/\r\n",

    "description": "Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme token which began as a fun currency and has now transformed into a decentralized ecosystem. During the initial launch, 50% of the supply was allocated into Vitalik Buterin's ethereum wallet. \r\n\r\nAs a result of that, Vitalik proceeded to donate 10% of his SHIB holdings to a COVID-19 relief effort in India and the remaining 40% is burnt forever. That donation was worth about $1 billion at that time, which makes it one of the largest donation ever in the world.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Shiba Inu community working on right now? The Shiba Inu team launched a decentralized exchange called Shibaswap with 2 new tokens, LEASH and BONE. LEASH is a scarce supply token that is used to offer incentives on Shibaswap. BONE is the governance token for holders to vote on proposals on Doggy DAO.",

    "description": "Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin with a protocol upgrade to fix on-chain capacity. Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original Bitcoin Core software. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core’s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC",

    "description": "Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive Scrypt proof of work mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at Coinbase, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. Dogecoin) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.",

    "description": "What is WETH (Wrapped ETH)?\r\nWETH is the tokenized/packaged form of ETH that you use to pay for items when you interact with Ethereum dApps. WETH follows the ERC-20 token standards, enabling it to achieve interoperability with other ERC-20 tokens. \r\n\r\nThis offers more utility to holders as they can use it across networks and dApps. You can stake, yield farm, lend, and provide liquidity to various liquidity pools with WETH. \r\n\r\nAlso, unlike ETH, which doesn’t conform to its own ERC-20 standard and thus has lower interoperability as it can’t be used on other chains besides Ethereum, WETH can be used on cheaper and high throughput alternatives like Binance, Polygon, Solana, and Cardano.\r\n\r\nThe price of WETH will always be the same as ETH because it maintains a 1:1 wrapping ratio.\r\n\r\nHow to Wrap ETH?\r\nCustodians wrap and unwrap ETH. To wrap ETH, you send ETH to a custodian. This can be a multi-sig wallet, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or a smart contract. After connecting your web3 wallet to a DeFi exchange, you enter the amount of ETH you wish to wrap and click the swap function. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive WETH tokens equivalent to the ETH that you’ve swapped.\r\n\r\nOn a centralized exchange, the exchange burns the deposited ETH and mints a wrapped form for you. And when you want to unwrap it, the exchange will burn the wrapped version and mint the ETH on your behalf.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Next for WETH?\r\nAccording to the developers, hopefully there will be no future for WETH. According to the website, steps are being taken to update ETH to make it compliant with its own ERC-20 standards. ",

    "description": "What Is Pi Network?\r\nPi Network is a social cryptocurrency, developer platform, and ecosystem designed for widespread accessibility and real-world utility. It enables users to mine and transact Pi using a mobile-friendly interface while supporting applications built within its blockchain ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSupply Model and Mining Mechanism\r\nThe Maximum Supply of Pi is 100 billion tokens. The Maximum Supply is comprised of the following: 65 Billion tokens (or 65%) are allocated for all community mining rewards; 10 billion (10%) are allocated for foundation reserves; 5 billion (5%) are allocated for liquidity purposes; and 20 billion (20%) are allocated for the Core Team. Each allocation mentioned above tracks the community Migrated Mining Rewards issuance pace, so the proportions of each allocation in the total supply remains the same at any given time. \r\n\r\nThe Effective Total Supply of Pi—the total Pi supply at the current time—allocates Pi proportionally the same as the Maximum Supply. Since every allocation tracks the Migrated Mining Rewards of the community, the Effective Total Supply can be calculated by dividing the current Migrated Mining Rewards of Pi on the Mainnet blockchain by 65%. The other allocations within the Effective Total Supply can then be calculated based on the same proportions as the Maximum Supply, e.g. at most 10% of the Effective Total Supply is available in the foundation reserve, 5% of the Effective Total Supply is available for liquidity purposes, and 20% of the Effective Total Supply is available for the Core Team. This remains true despite the fact that all tokens were minted at the genesis as technically required by the blockchain protocol.\r\n\r\nCirculating Supply includes all Migrated Mining Rewards and all tokens that entered circulation from other buckets of the allocations, which at its maximum could be summed up to equal the Effective Total Supply. \r\n\r\nPi’s mining rewards are distributed based on an issuance formula that follows a declining exponential model defined in the Pi whitepaper. Users can increase the amount of mining rewards they receive based on their individual contributions to the network, like Security Circles, using utility-based Pi apps, running Nodes, etc. For each month, the amount of Pi to be distributed as mobile balance is capped and determined by the model, regardless of how many people or how many types of mining rewards there are during the month. The capping is achieved by the design of a system-wide base mining rate, and each type of mining rewards to each individual are just a multiplier of this base mining rate. As the monthly supplies always diminish, the base mining rate generally decreases over time. \r\n\r\nFewer Pi may also be issued because the real Pi issuance on the blockchain depends on Pioneers passing KYC and completing all steps required for migration to the Mainnet. Despite all efforts to facilitate and remind Pioneers to complete those required steps, there are always dropoffs along the way, resulting in less than all outstanding mobile balances to be issued on the blockchain. Because of this mechanism, the community issued amount (Migrated Mining Rewards) on the blockchain will likely be closer and closer to a line lower than the 65 billion. This is thus the reason for the variable Effective Total Supply which incorporates this effect. Effective Total Supply results from all Migrated Mining Rewards divided by 65%, as opposed to the Maximum Supply of 100 billion.\r\n\r\nEcosystem and Adoption\r\nPi Network has built an integrated ecosystem that facilitates real-world transactions and decentralized applications. Pi can be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, including online commerce and local brick-and-mortar businesses.\r\n\r\nUsers can engage with Core Team and community-built apps in the Pi ecosystem through the Pi Browser, where integrated features like the Pi Wallet provide a seamless experience. Events like PiFest 2024 showcased Pi’s growing adoption, with over 27,000 active sellers and 28,000 test merchants across 160 countries.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Pi Network?\r\nPi Network was founded by Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, both of whom have PhDs from Stanford University and a passion for improving human lives through technology.\r\n\r\nDr. Nicolas Kokkalis is a Stanford PhD in EE and postdoc in CS with research on distributed systems and human-computer interaction. His work focuses on combining distributed systems and human computer interaction to bring cryptocurrency to everyday people. As a strong and long-term believer of the technical, financial and social potential of cryptocurrencies, he is determined to move them beyond their current limitations and is committed to bringing the power of blockchain to more people.\r\n\r\nDr. Chengdiao Fan holds a Stanford PhD in Anthropological Sciences, harnessing social computing to unlock human potential on a global scale. Chengdiao is building Pi Network to mobilize individuals all over the world to participate and be rewarded for their contributions, and establish an inclusive ecosystem for global citizens to unleash and capture their own agency, and in turn create utilities and productions for society and the world.\r\n\r\nCompliance and Identity Verification\r\nPi Network follows a one-account-per-person policy through its Know Your Customer (KYC) solution. This system combines machine automation and human verification to authenticate user identities while preserving privacy.\r\n\r\nThe KYC process emphasizes real individuals, combats fraudulent activities and enables fair participation in the mining process of the network. Pi’s identity verification approach balances scalability, security, and accessibility, allowing millions of users worldwide to validate their accounts while maintaining regulatory compliance.",

Wrapped assets, like cbBTC, are transferable tokens that are redeemable for the underlying asset. Coinbase customers can unwrap cbBTC and redeem a corresponding amount of the underlying BTC simply by depositing the cbBTC into their Coinbase accounts. cbBTC is built to be seamlessly compatible with DeFi applications, giving customers the option to tap into DeFi and unlock financial utility. cbBTC removes a key point of friction by allowing customers to use Bitcoin they already hold in new ways onchain. cbBTC is built to be seamlessly compatible with DeFi applications, so users can now tap into novel DeFi use cases like providing their Bitcoin as liquidity to DeFi protocols, using it as collateral to borrow other crypto assets, or spending it as a payment method. Wrapped assets like cbBTC are a mature concept in the crypto world, helping to bring more liquid assets onchain and facilitate an expansive financial ecosystem.\r\n",

    "description": "Internet Computer (IC) is the world’s first blockchain that is capable of running at web speed at unrestrictive capacities. Built by the DFINITY Foundation, IC aims to recreate the web by supporting smart contract development at scale and changing the way people can interact using web services. Internet Computer aims to extend the public internet, so that it can be the world’s computing platform, in a decentralized manner. Internet Computer sets to revolutionalize the design of the crypto economy, with an aim to overhaul traditional software services. \r\n\r\nThe project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic WIllams and have raised a total of $121 million from investors such as Adreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Multicoin Capital and such. On May 10, 2021, DFINITY launched the Internet Computer into the public domain, marking it a major milestone for ICP as it means the internet now functions as a decentralised global computer. This is marked by the release of all of the Internet Computer’s source code into the public domain, as well as ICP utility token that allows tens of thousands of community members to govern the Internet Computer network.\r\n\r\nICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles:\r\n\r\n1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI\r\n2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used.\r\n3. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network.",
