    "description": "Bitcoin is the first successful internet money based on peer-to-peer technology; whereby no central bank or authority is involved in the transaction and production of the Bitcoin currency. It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency. Bitcoin uses the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=SHA-256\">SHA-256</a> hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.\r\n\r\nBeing the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peercoin\">Peercoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/primecoin\">Primecoin</a>, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> which led to the development of other amazing projects such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">Tron</a>, and even crypto-collectibles such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/ethereum-still-king-dapps-cryptokitties-need-1-billion-on-eos\">CryptoKitties</a>.",

    "description": "Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible. Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.\r\n\r\nOn Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain. The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand.",

    "description": "Ripple is the catchall name for the cryptocurrency platform, the transactional protocol for which is actually XRP, in the same fashion as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> is the name for the platform that facilitates trades in Ether. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.\r\n\r\nRipple was originally founded by a single company, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs\">Ripple Labs</a>, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin’s</a> development. It also doesn’t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself — around 60 billion at the latest count.\r\n\r\nEven at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple’s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency’s value, and isn’t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.\r\n\r\nXRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S. dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> platform. It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name \"Binance\" is a combination of binary and finance.\r\n\r\nThus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other. It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat. The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.\r\n\r\nIn total, there will only be 200 million BNBs. Binance uses the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?asset_platform_id=279\">ERC20 token standard</a> from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors. The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB. \r\n\r\nThe schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.\r\n\r\nBinance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors. In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.\r\n\r\nOther tokens that are issued by exchanges include <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bibox-token\">Bibox Token</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/okb\">OKB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/huobi-token\">Huobi Token</a>, and more.",

    "description": "Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency based on the popular \"Doge\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. Dogecoin is a <a href=\"/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a> fork. Introduced as a \"joke currency\" on 6 December 2013, Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. \r\n\r\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\r\n\r\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.\r\n\r\nTo purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency. Once we have set up an account with a DOGE currency exchange and deposited some funds, you are ready to start trading. ",

    "description": "What is Tron?\r\nTron's mission is to build a truly decentralized internet and aims to be the largest blockchain-based operating system in the world, known as the TRON protocol. The TRON protocol will offer high scalability, high availability, and high throughput computing to serve decentralized applications via smart contracts. Ethereum EVM-based smart contracts will be compatible and deployable on the TRON network as such Solidity developers do not have to rewrite their applications.\r\n\r\nWhy Tron?\r\nSince TRON protocol does not rely on proof of work or mining, instead governed by nodes located around the world, it is decentralized while providing high throughput for transactions on the blockchain. This is suitable for dapps that require high speed transactions especially games. There are a number of tokens already issued on the TRON network and the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/trx_market\">decentralized exchanges TRX.market</a> has launched.\r\n\r\nOn July 24th 2018, TRON acquired BitTorrent, one of the largest P2P file sharing protocol. As a result of the acquisition, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bittorrent\">BitTorrent Token (BTT)</a> was launched as the cryptocurrency to power the economics on the BitTorrent network. The Token will be used to inceltivize file sharing and storage within the network.\r\n",

    "description": "The Stellar network is an open source, distributed, and community owned network used to facilitate cross-asset transfers of value. Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\">XRP</a> and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.\r\n\r\nDistributed Exchange\r\nThrough the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.\r\n\r\nThis multi-currency transaction is possible because of \"Anchors\". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people’s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.\r\n\r\nLumens (XLM)\r\nLumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. \r\n\r\nPrior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.\r\n\r\nAs the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn’t working as intended — account holders either didn’t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise — and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe inflation operation is now deprecated.\r\nhttps://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/inflation/\r\n",

    "description": "What is WETH (Wrapped ETH)?\r\nWETH is the tokenized/packaged form of ETH that you use to pay for items when you interact with Ethereum dApps. WETH follows the ERC-20 token standards, enabling it to achieve interoperability with other ERC-20 tokens. \r\n\r\nThis offers more utility to holders as they can use it across networks and dApps. You can stake, yield farm, lend, and provide liquidity to various liquidity pools with WETH. \r\n\r\nAlso, unlike ETH, which doesn’t conform to its own ERC-20 standard and thus has lower interoperability as it can’t be used on other chains besides Ethereum, WETH can be used on cheaper and high throughput alternatives like Binance, Polygon, Solana, and Cardano.\r\n\r\nThe price of WETH will always be the same as ETH because it maintains a 1:1 wrapping ratio.\r\n\r\nHow to Wrap ETH?\r\nCustodians wrap and unwrap ETH. To wrap ETH, you send ETH to a custodian. This can be a multi-sig wallet, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or a smart contract. After connecting your web3 wallet to a DeFi exchange, you enter the amount of ETH you wish to wrap and click the swap function. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive WETH tokens equivalent to the ETH that you’ve swapped.\r\n\r\nOn a centralized exchange, the exchange burns the deposited ETH and mints a wrapped form for you. And when you want to unwrap it, the exchange will burn the wrapped version and mint the ETH on your behalf.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Next for WETH?\r\nAccording to the developers, hopefully there will be no future for WETH. According to the website, steps are being taken to update ETH to make it compliant with its own ERC-20 standards. ",

    "description": "Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt\">Scrypt proof of work</a> mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coinbase_pro\">Coinbase</a>, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a>) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.",

    "description": "Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> with a protocol upgrade to fix on-chain capacity. Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/developer#panel\">Bitcoin Core software</a>. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core’s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-sv\">Bitcoin SV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-abc\">Bitcoin ABC</a>",

The chain currently supports 100k orders / second.\r\n\r\nThe Hyperliquid L1 uses a custom consensus algorithm called HyperBFT which is heavily inspired by Hotstuff and its successors. Both the algorithm and networking stack are optimized from the ground up to support the L1. \r\n\r\nThe flagship native application is a fully onchain order book perpetuals exchange, the Hyperliquid DEX. Further developments include a native token standard, spot trading, permissionless liquidity, etc.",

    "description": "Internet Computer (IC) is the world’s first blockchain that is capable of running at web speed at unrestrictive capacities. Built by the DFINITY Foundation, IC aims to recreate the web by supporting smart contract development at scale and changing the way people can interact using web services. Internet Computer aims to extend the public internet, so that it can be the world’s computing platform, in a decentralized manner. Internet Computer sets to revolutionalize the design of the crypto economy, with an aim to overhaul traditional software services. \r\n\r\nThe project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic WIllams and have raised a total of $121 million from investors such as Adreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Multicoin Capital and such. On May 10, 2021, DFINITY launched the Internet Computer into the public domain, marking it a major milestone for ICP as it means the internet now functions as a decentralised global computer. This is marked by the release of all of the Internet Computer’s source code into the public domain, as well as ICP utility token that allows tens of thousands of community members to govern the Internet Computer network.\r\n\r\nICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles:\r\n\r\n1. Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI\r\n2. Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used.\r\n3. Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network.",

    "description": "Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency which implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG does not orphan blocks created in parallel, rather allows them to coexist and orders them in consensus. Whereby our blockchain is actually a blockDAG; you can see GHOSTDAG in action in a real time blockDAG visualizer). This generalization of Nakamoto consensus allows for secure operation while maintaining very high block rates (currently one block per second, aiming for 10/sec, dreaming of 100/sec) and minuscule confirmation times dominated by internet latency (cf. chapter 6 of the the paper for some initial benchmarks). The Kaspa implementation includes a lot of cool features and subprotocols including Reachability to query the DAG's topology, Block data pruning (with near-future plans for block header pruning), SPV proofs, and later subnetwork support which will make future implementation of layer 2 solutions much easier.",
